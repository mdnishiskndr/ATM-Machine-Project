This individual project is developed to fulfill CSC404 project course requirement

This project is designed to developed an ATM Machine using C++ programming language that can allow user to create a bank account and use it to withdraw money, deposit money and request their balance.

The user will create their bank account by supplying their id and password then use it to login into the system. If the login was successful the user will be able to withdraw money, deposit money and request their balance. If login was not successful (for example the id or password did not match) then the user will be
taken back to the introduction menu.
